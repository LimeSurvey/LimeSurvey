HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
http://docs.limesurvey.org

Please also have a look at the "Installation security hints" section of the online manual in order to secure your installation.


=== UPGRADING=====

We suggest to check out and hold close to the instructions, which can be found in our online manual:
http://docs.limesurvey.org/tiki-index.php?page=Upgrading+from+a+previous+version
 

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<=1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry but you can't upgrade from versions <= 1.0.8. Seriously! 
The database structure has changed that much it wouldn't be feasible.
However, you can import old survey structures from version 1.0 (when you create a new survey there is an option to do that).
Just do a new installation as described on http://docs.limesurvey.org.


HOW TO UPGRADE from LimeSurvey 1.45 or later (<=1.70)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database.
2. Backup your config.php.
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place.
5. Adjust the settings in config.php to the setting from the backup config.php. 
   --Do NOT just copy over the old config.php over the new one.--
6. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database.
7. Done.

Special note for UPGRADING from 1.53 to 1.72(+)
------------------------------------------------
After you upgraded please check the global user rights of each user. There was a 
new superadmin right introduced. The upgrade script is guessing who to make 
superadmin - so this is not perfect and has to be supervised by YOU. 

HOW TO UPGRADE from a LimeSurvey 1.70(+) version to the latest 1.90
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files (especially config.php and config-ldap.php)
   and database.
2. Export all your customized templates.
3. Backup your limesurvey/upload resources directory.
4. Delete all old files. 
5. Upload the new version to the same place.
6. Copy your backuped config.php file overwriting the one from the new release 
7. Have a look to the config-defaults.php file for any new parameters that 
   could suit your setup. If you need to change the default setting, copy the
   parameter lines to your config.php file and adjust their values accordingly.
8. Copy your previously backuped 'upload' directory to the new 
   limesurvey/upload directory.
9. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database.
10. Copy back all your customized templates to /upload/templates. You might have to adjust your templates since the CSS has been changed since version 1.72x. 
    It is easier to try adapting one of the default templates to your template again instead of fixing your old template! 
11. Done.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.

and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
      Thank you very much to Shawn Wales (sf.net name: swales)!
    - Allows the user to select the width of the text area with long free text and huge free text questions
      Thank you very much to Shawn Wales (sf.net name: swales)!

* New system option to set the table type in MySQL

* New "assessments" feature which allows you to sum the 
answers to groups of questions, or the total survey, and then 
present an "assessment" when the users submits the survey.

* New survey options, including:
 - the capacity to set the "subject" of emails on a survey-by-survey basis
 - hide the "<< prev" button so users can only go forwards through a survey
 - Allow users to save a partially completed survey and come back to complete it later
