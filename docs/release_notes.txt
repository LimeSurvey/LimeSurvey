Changes from 0.991 to 0.992

New features:

Added croatian language file (submitted by Ivana Pavic)!
Change survey sent/taken from "Y" to the date:
    When reviewing the tokens display, the fields telling if the survey request was sent,
    and the survey taken, display a N or Y. This was changed to be the actual date this event took place.
    This is giving some siginificant additional information to the survey author. (Patch by Thomas Ringate / tringate!)
New global option that allows the administrator to specify what is the minimum number of remaining answers
    in an 'array - flexible' question that must be remaining before repeating the question headings. This
    avoids that the headings of the question are repeated if only a few answers are remaining. (Patch by Kris Ven !)

Changes:
Moved admin CSS styles to separate CSS file
Updated slovenian language file
Updated dutch language file
Updated french language file (by Pascal Bastien/pascal-gnu)

* List type question divided into two question types - radio
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together.
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.
  READ THE STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE!!!!

and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and Huge free text
