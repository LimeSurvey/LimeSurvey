This release does have the following requirements:

-One of these databases:  MySQL 4.1 or higher, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or higher, Postgres 7 or higher 
-PHP 4.3 or higher with mbstring library installed. (for localizations)


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
http://docs.limesurvey.org



=== UPGRADING=====

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<=1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry but you can't upgrade from versions <= 1.0.8. Seriously! 
The database structure has changed that much it wouldn't be feasible.
However, you can import old survey structures from version 1.0 (when you create a new survey there is an option to do that).
Just do a new installation as described on http://docs.limesurvey.org.


HOW TO UPGRADE from LimeSurvey 1.45 or later (<=1.70)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database.
2. Backup your config.php.
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place.
5. Adjust the settings in config.php to the setting from the backup config.php. 
   --Do NOT just copy over the old config.php over the new one.--
6. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database.
7. Done.

Special note for UPGRADING from 1.53 to 1.72(+)
-----------------------------------------------
After you upgraded please check the global user rights of each user. There was a 
new superadmin right introduced. The upgrade script is guessing who to make 
superadmin - so this is not perfect and has to be supervised by YOU. 

HOW TO UPGRADE from a LimeSurvey 1.70(+) version to the latest 1.80(+)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files (especially config.php and config-ldap.php)
   and database.
2. Export all templates that you added/edited or customized.
3. Backup your limesurvey/upload resources directory.
4. Delete all old files. 
5. Upload the new version to the same place.
6. Copy your backuped config.php file overwriting the one from the new release 
7. Have a look to the config-defaults.php file for any new parameters that 
   could suit your setup. If you need to change the default setting, copy the
   parameter lines to your config.php file and adjust their values accordingly.
8. Copy your previously backuped 'upload' directory to the new 
   limesurvey/upload directory. 
9. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database.
10. Import all your saved templates.
11. Done.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

Changes from 0.991 to 0.992

New features:

Added croatian language file (submitted by Ivana Pavic)!
Change survey sent/taken from "Y" to the date:
	When reviewing the tokens display, the fields telling if the survey request was sent, 
	and the survey taken, display a N or Y. This was changed to be the actual date this event took place. 
	This is giving some siginificant additional information to the survey author. (Patch by Thomas Ringate / tringate!)
New global option that allows the administrator to specify what is the minimum number of remaining answers 
	in an 'array - flexible' question that must be remaining before repeating the question headings. This 
	avoids that the headings of the question are repeated if only a few answers are remaining. (Patch by Kris Ven !)

Moved admin CSS styles to separate CSS file
Updated slovenian language file
Updated dutch language file
Updated french language file (by Pascal Bastien/pascal-gnu)

=========================

1.) New question types

* List type question divided into two question types - radio 
button or drop down, so you can choose on a question by 
question basis whether or not to have radio buttons or a 
dropdown list.

* New "flexible" list type question uses labelsets to make reusing 
sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

2.) New features

* UTF-8 conversion. Use any char of any language mixed together. 
  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully. 
  READ THE STATEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FILE!!!!

* Question attributes, allows for better control over the display 
and working of individual questions - for example:

    - Have multiple choice or list questions display in multiple columns
    - Set a maximum character length on text questions
    - Adjust the width of  the input box in text questions
    - Hide the tip "Please Choose One" of selected questions
        - Allow the user to select the number of lines the text area will have with long free text and huge free text
