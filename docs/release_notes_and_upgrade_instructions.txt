-PHP 4.3 or higher with mbstring library installed. (for localizations)


HOW TO INSTALL
---------------
If you are doing a complete new installation please refer to the manual at
http://docs.limesurvey.org



=== UPGRADING=====

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<=1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry but you can't upgrade from versions <= 1.0.8. Seriously! 
The database structure has changed that much it wouldn't be feasible.
However, you can import old survey structures from version 1.0 (when you create a new survey there is an option to do that).
Just do a new installation as described on http://docs.limesurvey.org.


HOW TO UPGRADE from LimeSurvey 1.45 or later (<=1.70)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database.
2. Backup your config.php.
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place
5. Adjust the settings in config.php to the setting from the backup config.php. 
   --Do NOT just copy over the old config.php over the new one.--
6. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database.
7. Done.

Special note for UPGRADING from 1.53 to 1.71(+)
-----------------------------------------------
After you upgraded please check the global user rights of each user. There was a 
new superadmin right introduced. The upgrade script is guessing who to make 
superadmin - so this is not perfect and has to be supervised by YOU. 

HOW TO UPGRADE from a LimeSurvey 1.70(+) version to the latest 1.71(+)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files (especially config.php and config-ldap.php)
   and database.
2. Export all templates that have been edited
3. Backup your limesurvey/upload resources directory
4. Delete all old files 
5. Upload the new version to the same place
6. Have a look at the provided config.php in order to check if some new
   required parameters have been added and add these to your previous
   config.php file.
7. Copy your backuped config.php file overwriting the one from the new release 
8. Have a look to the config-defaults.php file for any new parameters that 
   could suit your setup. If you need to change the default setting, copy the
   parameter lines to your config.php file and adjust their values accordingly.
9. Copy your previously backuped 'upload' directory to the new 
   limesurvey/upload directory 
10. Run the installer in /admin/install/index.php to update the database
11. Import all your saved templates
12. Done.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!

sets of answers easier - one radio and one dropdown type

* New "Huge" text question allows for a _really big_ textarea

  The problems with mixed up charsets are gone now hopefully.
