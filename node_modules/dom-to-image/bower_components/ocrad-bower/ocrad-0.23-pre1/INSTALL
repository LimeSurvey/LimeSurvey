Requirements
------------
You will need a C++ compiler.
I use gcc 4.8.1 and 3.3.6, but the code should compile with any
standards compliant compiler.
Gcc is available at http://gcc.gnu.org.


Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xf ocrad[version].tar.lz
or
	lzip -cd ocrad[version].tar.lz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./ocrad[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to ocrad directory and run configure.
   (Try 'configure --help' for usage instructions).

	cd ocrad[version]
	./configure

3. Run make.

	make

4. Optionally, type 'make check' to run the tests that come with ocrad.

5. Type 'make install' to install the program, the library and any data
   files and documentation.

   You can install only the program, the info manual or the man page
   typing 'make install-bin', 'make install-info' or 'make install-man'
   respectively.


Another way
-----------
You can also compile ocrad into a separate directory. To do this, you
must use a version of 'make' that supports the 'VPATH' variable, such
as GNU 'make'. 'cd' to the directory where you want the object files
and executables to go and run the 'configure' script. 'configure'
automatically checks for the source code in '.', in '..' and in the
directory that 'configure' is in.

'configure' recognizes the option '--srcdir=DIR' to control where to
look for the sources. Usually 'configure' can determine that directory
automatically.

After running 'configure', you can run 'make' and 'make install' as
explained above.
