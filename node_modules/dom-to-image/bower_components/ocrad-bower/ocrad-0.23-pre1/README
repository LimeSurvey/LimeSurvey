Description

GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program and library
based on a feature extraction method. It reads images in pbm (bitmap),
pgm (greyscale) or ppm (color) formats and produces text in byte (8-bit)
or UTF-8 formats. The pbm, pgm and ppm formats are collectively known as
pnm.

Ocrad includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or blocks
of text normally found on printed pages.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Try "ocrad --help" for usage instructions.

Caveats.
For better results the characters should be at least 20 pixels high. If
they are smaller, try the --scale option.
Merged characters are always a problem. Try to avoid them.
Very bold or very light (broken) characters are also a problem.
Always see with your own eyes the pnm file before blaming ocrad for the
results. Remember the saying, "garbage in, garbage out".

Ideas, comments, patches, donations (hardware, money, etc), etc, are welcome.
