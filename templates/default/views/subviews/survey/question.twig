    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.· Question Layout  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    This file is one of the most important of the rendering progress.
    It will render a question. It's included in the for loop in group.twig

    Here, you have access to the array aQuestion that contains the datas of the current question
    To see what's inside aQuestion, turn debug mode on, and put out of the comment section this statement: {{ dump(aQuestion) }}

    All the content of aQuestion it self is generated from qanda_helper.
    To modify it, you must create a question template and apply it to the question in its display settings
    (here, you're inside the survey template, applied to the survey in its settings)
