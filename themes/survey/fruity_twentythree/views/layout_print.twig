    This is the layout that will be used to print the survey to pdf
    If you're creating your own template, remember there is no obligation to respect the current file flow of this template.
    This is different from the old LimeSurvey template engine, where you had to provide every one of the pstpl files.
    Here, you must have a file called layout_global.twig (called from SurveyRuntimeHelper::run() ).
    Other than that, you're free to organize your files and inclusions as you want.
