    This div will often change from a template to another.
    So, to keep changes between ls-inherited templates as slighty as possible, we put it in a separated file

#}

<!-- outer frame container -->
<div role="main" class="{{ aSurveyInfo.class.outerframe }} container-fluid"
     id="{{ aSurveyInfo.id.outerframe }}" {{ aSurveyInfo.attr.outerframe }} >
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-centered col-xl-8">
            {# Which file to include for content is decided inside the layout #}
            {% include './subviews/content/mainrow.twig' with {'include_content': include_content } %}
