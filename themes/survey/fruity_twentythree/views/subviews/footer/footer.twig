Add your footer in this file.

You will need to add custom CSS to make this work, for example, the following
should work for a bottom-aligned footer in all browsers that properly support
flex:

body {
     padding-bottom: 0; /* no bottom padding, footer should be bottom aligned */
     padding-top: 60px;/* now is redefine in JS to fit any title length */
     flex-direction: column; /* article, then footer */
     display: flex; /* flex, to extend the content to full size */
     min-height: 100vh; /* full height, to bottom-align footer */
}
body > article {
    flex: 1; /* the main article should use as much space as possible */
}

#}
