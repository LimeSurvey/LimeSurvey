    (¯`·._.·(¯`·._.·  Test Welcome / Privacy for All in one mode  ·._.·´¯)·._.·´¯)

    This file is only a piece of logic, it doesn't show nothing. We use it to hide complexity in layout.twig

    When survey is in All In One mode, if welcome or privacy message are activated, they must be shown on the page.
