/**
 * Exception class for Zend_Pdf.
 *
 * If you expect a certain type of exception to be caught and handled by the
 * caller, create a constant for it here and include it in the object being
 * thrown. Example:
 *
 *   throw new Zend_Pdf_Exception('foo() is not yet implemented',
 *                                Zend_Pdf_Exception::NOT_IMPLEMENTED);
 *
 * This allows the caller to determine the specific type of exception that was
 * thrown without resorting to parsing the descriptive text.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Do not rely on numeric values of the constants! They are grouped
 * sequentially below for organizational purposes only. The numbers may come to
 * mean something in the future, but they are subject to renumbering at any
 * time. ALWAYS use the symbolic constant names, which are guaranteed never to
 * change, in logical checks! You have been warned.
