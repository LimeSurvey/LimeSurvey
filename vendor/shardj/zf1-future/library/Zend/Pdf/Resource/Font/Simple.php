/**
 * Adobe PDF Simple fonts implementation
 *
 * PDF simple fonts functionality is presented by Adobe Type 1
 * (including standard PDF Type1 built-in fonts) and TrueType fonts support.
 *
 * Both fonts have the following properties:
 * - Glyphs in the font are selected by single-byte character codes obtained from a
 *   string that is shown by the text-showing operators. Logically, these codes index
 *   into a table of 256 glyphs; the mapping from codes to glyphs is called the fontâ€™s
 *   encoding.
 *   PDF specification provides a possibility to specify any user defined encoding in addition
 *   to the standard built-in encodings: Standard-Encoding, MacRomanEncoding, WinAnsiEncoding,
 *   and PDFDocEncoding, but Zend_Pdf simple fonts implementation operates only with
 *   Windows ANSI encoding (except Symbol and ZapfDingbats built-in fonts).
 *
 * - Each glyph has a single set of metrics, including a horizontal displacement or
 *   width. That is, simple fonts support only horizontal writing mode.
 *
 *
 * The code in this class is common to both types. However, you will only deal
 * directly with subclasses.
 *
 * Font objects should be normally be obtained from the factory methods
 * {@link Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithName} and {@link Zend_Pdf_Font::fontWithPath}.
