     *
     * Why we need this:
     *  While GFS supports cluster-wide locking via flock(), it's
     *  implementation isn't quite what it should be.  The locking
     *  semantics that work consistently on a local filesystem tend to
     *  fail on GFS mounted filesystems.  This appears to be a design defect
     *  in the implementation of GFS.  How this manifests itself is that
     *  conditional promotion of a shared lock to exclusive will always
     *  fail, lock release requests are honored but not immediately
     *  processed (causing erratic failures of subsequent conditional
     *  requests) and the releasing of the exclusive lock before the
     *  shared lock is set when a lock is demoted (which can open a window
     *  of opportunity for another process to gain an exclusive lock when
     *  it shoudln't be allowed to).
