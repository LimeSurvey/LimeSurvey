    /**
     * The shipping method that was used for determining the cost of shipping.
     *
     * For example: flat rate, calculated, or free. The seller specifies the
     * available shipping services when they list the item.
     *
     * Applicable values:
     *
     *     Calculated
     *     The calculated shipping model: The posted cost of shipping is based
     *     on the buyer-selected shipping service, chosen by the buyer from the
     *     different shipping services offered by the seller. The shipping costs
     *     are calculated by eBay and the shipping carrier, based on the buyer's
     *     address. Any packaging and handling costs established by the seller
     *     are automatically rolled into the total.
     *
     *     CalculatedDomesticFlatInternational
     *     The seller specified one or more calculated domestic shipping
     *     services and one or more flat international shipping services.
     *
     *     Flat
     *     The flat-rate shipping model: The seller establishes the cost of
     *     shipping and any shipping insurance, regardless of what any
     *     buyer-selected shipping service might charge the seller.
     *
     *     FlatDomesticCalculatedInternational
     *     The seller specified one or more flat domestic shipping services and
     *     one or more calculated international shipping services.
     *
     *     Free
     *     Free is used when the seller has declared that shipping is free for
     *     the buyer.
     *
     *     FreePickup
     *     No shipping available, the buyer must pick up the item from the
     *     seller.
     *
     *     Freight
     *     The freight shipping model: the cost of shipping is determined by a
     *     third party, FreightQuote.com, based on the buyer's address (postal
     *     code).
     *
     *     FreightFlat
     *     The flat rate shipping model: the seller establishes the cost of
     *     freight shipping and freight insurance, regardless of what any
     *     buyer-selected shipping service might charge the seller.
     *
     *     NotSpecified
     *     The seller did not specify the shipping type.
